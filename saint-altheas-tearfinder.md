# Saint Althea's Tearfinder

This artifact is a heavy tear-shaped pendant with a single grain of bonded manatite encased in clear sapphire. Wearing it counts as skin contact with the manatite inside and will cause changes in the wearer with prolonged contact.

In order to be used, it must be attuned to a follower of Vittorio the Ascended, Saint Althea or one of the other saints in Vittorio's order.

When worn, it grants the following abilities:
* The wearer can cast *Detect Magic* as an action once per long rest and an unlimited number of times as a ritual. This does not expend a spell slot.
* The wearer gains +1 AC and +1 on wisdom-based savings throws.
* As a ritual, the wearer can cast *Find Tear* twice per long rest. This spell is a combination of *Detect Magic*, *Precognition*, and *Locate Object* that will present the caster with  a vision of where they should head in order to be there when a manatite meteorite lands next. They will also know the general direction of the impact point and how long they have before the impact. Until the event predicted happens, the caster will be able to, as an action, see the vision again and check the direction.

If there is no impact coming within 500 miles over the next seven days, the ritual will produce no vision.

This artifact was created by Vittorio the Ascended for Saint Althea and passed down through the royal line of the Kingdom of Santa Althea to Prince Joao.
