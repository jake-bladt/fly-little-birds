# Artifact: Torq of the Dire Bear

*Torc, legendary (requires attunement by a circle of the moon druid)*

This golden torq is a simple rope design with facing terminals in the form of two roaring bear heads. When attuned by a Circle of Moon druid, that druid can use one charge of *wildshape* per long rest to take the form of a [dire bear](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Dire_Bear_(5e_Creature)).

Additionally, when wildshaped into any bear form, the druid may, as a bonus action, cast *Distracting Bellow* in a 10' cone directly in front of her. All enemies caught in the effect must make a DC 15 wisdom save or, until the end of their next turn, take disadvantage to attack anyone other than the druid.
