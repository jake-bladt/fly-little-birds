# Artifact: Resplendent Cuirass of the Souzas

This heirloom of the Janoto-Souza family was a wedding gift from Queen Ana-Paola Rezende to Getulio Souza on his marriage to Bianca Janoto, joining those two families  into a single dynasty.

Getulio was a paladin of Vittorio the Ascended and began the tradition of passing the cuirass down from first-born son to first-born son when that son formally accepted a position in the Sacred Order of Vittorio the Ascended.

The cuirass counts as half-plate, gives +1 additional AC to the wearer, and weighs next to nothing. It is enchanted to never scratch, dent, break, or become tarnished and can be worn while swimming without penalty.

In addition, three times per long rest, the wearer can cast *Light* focused on the cuirass without expending a spell slot. Additionally, once per long rest, the wearer can cast *Burst of Light* which causes all enemies in front of him for 30' to be hit with *Blindness/Deafness* (blindness only.)
